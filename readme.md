# An Incremental Algorithm for Large Scale Learning

This project aims to explore the dual coordinate descent algorithms proposed by Yu, Huang, and Lin in their paper 'Dual Coordinate Descent Methods for Logistic Regression and Maximum Entropy Models', available here: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/maxent_dual.pdf

The algorithms aims to improve computational efficiency for the dual problem of Maximum Entropy and Logistic Regression, multi-class and binary classification, respectively. 

In this project we implement the algorithms, and compare them to similar algorithms learned in the course MATH-412, Statistical Machine Learning at EPFL.
